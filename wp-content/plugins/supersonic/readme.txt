Wordpress SuperSonic with CloudFlare

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= CloudFlare is required? =

**Yes**. Without CloudFlare SuperSonic functions will not works.

= Which Page Rules should You define in CloudFlare? =

To properly working Supersonic requires **at least 3 Page Rules** in CloudFlare.

1. URL pattern: /\*.php\*
   Custom caching: Bypass cache
2. URL pattern: /\*wp-admin\*
   Custom caching: Bypass cache
3. URL pattern: /\*
   Custom caching: Cache everything
   Edge cache expire TTL: 1 week
   Browser cache expire TTL: 30 minutes

**Rules order is very important!**

= How to configure Supersonic to serve non cached pages with Admin Bar for logged in users? =

Supersonic serves front end pages as for non logged in users (except pages that are defined in options).
But for users with specified roles there is posibility to serve non cached pages. It is done by adding parameter (supersonic=wp-admin) to all frontend URLs.

CloudFlare should not cache pages with this parameter. There must be PageRule with Custom caching: Bypass cache.
If you have Page Rule with URL pattern /wp-admin/* or /wp-admin* siply change URL pattern to /\*wp-admin\*
